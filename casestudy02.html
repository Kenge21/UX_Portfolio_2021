            <h6>Project Overview</h6>
            <p> Our non-profit redesign is for Books for Keeps which gives books to<br>children who have limited access
                to reading materials because of<br>factors like geography or income. Books for Keeps is based
                in<br>Athens, GA and after looking at the current Books for Keeps website,<br>it was clear to our group
                that we could make a lot of improvements.<br>So to start off our research, I got in touch with the Books
                for Keeps<br>executive director. And it turns out that they’ve had<br>“website redesign” on their to-do
                list for seven years which is a<br>happy coincidence for us.<br><br>After talking with the BFK Executive
                Director, she made it clear that<br>her biggest frustrations were that the current website isn’t
                mobile<br>friendly and it’s not necessarily easy to navigate because of the<br>amount of pages and
                content on those pages. So our focus was on<br>implementing a responsive web design and reorganizing the
                website’s<br>most crucial information.</p>

                <h6>Background</h6>
                <p>Books for Keeps is a non-profit organization that focuses<br>on investment in early childhood
                    education. They work<br>to end the “Summer Slide,” the learning loss suffered<br>by many children
                    when they are away from school.<br>This disadvantage primarily affects children from low<br>income
                    families due to lack of access to books.
                </p>
                <h6>Goal</h6>
                <p>We aim to redesign the Books for Keeps website in a<br>way that increases donations/volunteers and
                    publicity.<br>Overall, we would like to make the website more<br>intuitive, responsive and visually
                    pleasing.</p>

                    you do with books once you or your child have<br>read them?<br><br>3. How do a majority of users
                    prefer to get involved?<br><br>4. Describe a time when you have either donated money<br>or given
                    items away.

                <p>Leslie’s insight was crucial to our design decision making, and her<br>feedback along with the
                    feedback from our general interviews<br>really grounded us from the beginning to end of this
                    project. Leslie<br>told us that Books for Keeps primarily targets community<br>stakeholders because
                    90% of the books given to students are<br>bought with the money donated by community sponsors.
                    Some<br>other key findings that were unanimous in all interviews was the<br>importance of telling a
                    clear and captivating story, which not only<br>makes Books for Keeps more credible as an
                    organization, but it<br>also makes users more comfortable with the idea of donating.<br>Keeping all
                    of our research in mind, our overall goals for this<br>redesign were to increase donations, make the
                    website mobile<br>friendly and refresh the design so that it’s exciting, playful and<br>matches the

                inviting, warm and<br>enthusiastic. Orange is an attention grabbing color that may prompt users to click
                around the website<br>more than they would if it were a less motivating color.</p>

            only clickable items. We also adjusted the design of the primary header to be more in line<br>with our

            through clear but playful UI that matches the tone of the <br>organization. In the future, we hope to create
            an “Event Page” that allows volunteers to <br>organize fundraisers to increase donations to the non profit
            as well as raise awareness<br>to the community about what Books for Keeps does. We were also presented with
            the <br>opportunity to work with Books for Keeps in the future with a website redesign. We <br>will present
            this case study to the Executive Director as a team and work to solve the <br>needs of the non profit and
            their users. </p>
